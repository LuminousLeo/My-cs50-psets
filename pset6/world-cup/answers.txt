Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Well, the real run time of each simulation did increase, but not as much as i was expecting.
    10 simulations and 1000 simulations preaty much have the same run time but, of course, 1000 simulations was much more accurate, and then you have 100000 and 1000000 simulations wich,
    again have preaty simular run times but the outcome of the program changes almost nothing if anything.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Well, according to the response that i gave in the previous question i'd say that 1000 simulations is good enough.
Because the chance 0f winning for each team did not change that much, if anything, from 1000 simulations to 1000000, and it was much quicker, even though none reached even a second, but
because 1000 simulations was much quicker i'd say that 1000 simulations is good enough
